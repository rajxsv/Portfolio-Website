My consistent contributions to GitHub to projects like DSA-HUB, where I'm developing an open-source alternative for LeetCode, showcase my commitment to staying updated with modern technologies. Additionally, my understanding and implementation of the MERN stack in DSA-HUB demonstrate my proficiency in full-stack development. Alongside my academic excellence, my roles as a Problem Setter at CodeChef and an official mentor at NITJ highlight my leadership and mentoring skills. Notably, projects like DSA HUB and ROZGAAR BHARAT demonstrate my proficiency in full-stack development and my commitment to social impact. Furthermore, my achievements, such as publishing articles on platforms like Geeks for Geeks and winning hackathons, reflect my passion for continuous learning and innovation. With expertise spanning various languages and frameworks, including JavaScript, React JS, Node JS, Express JS, and MongoDB, I am well-equipped to contribute meaningfully to your projects from day one.", "item-2", "item-3"],
